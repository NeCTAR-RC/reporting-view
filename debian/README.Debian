reporting-view for Debian
-------------------------

This package is almost completely javascript, with a single minimal flask based
wsgi application. To configure it, modify the provided apache.conf file
according to your site requirements, pointing mod_wsgi at the reporting_view.py
script. Then modify the reporting-view.conf file appropriately for your
environment and place it in /etc/reporting-view/.

In addition, the file /etc/reporting-view/config.js will need to be customised
after installation. This is symlinked into the /usr/share/reporting-view/static
directory and used by the application.
