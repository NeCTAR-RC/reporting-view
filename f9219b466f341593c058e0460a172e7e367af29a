Eg. in a production env I would expect that the directory and the secret key would be created by the deb post install.\n\nNot saying this isn\u0027t good as it will work well in dev and will work without having to worry about anything (so maybe the default for /tmp is good). Just maybe in prod it could be different and this doesn\u0027t allow that.",
