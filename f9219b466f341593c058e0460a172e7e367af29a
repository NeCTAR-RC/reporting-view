Eg. in a production env I would expect that the directory and the secret key would be created by the deb post install.\n\nNot saying this isn\u0027t good as it will work well in dev and will work without having to worry about anything (so maybe the default for /tmp is good). Just maybe in prod it could be different and this doesn\u0027t allow that.",

      "message": "The secret key is specifically for maintaining session state across restarts - if it goes away then users will need to log in again, but it\u0027s not something that needs to be statically defined in a config or similar. Regenerating it whenever it\u0027s not available makes more sense to me.\n\nPutting it in /tmp (or somewhere else that will be cleaned up automatically) seems like a good approach, and since it\u0027s not encrypting anything really critical (just the current session state) it doesn\u0027t need to be somewhere highly cryptic. We\u0027re also running as a user that won\u0027t have write permissions on /var/run, which is the other logical place to put it.\n\nI also figure that keeping the server side app as simple as possible, preferably with no configuration at all, is the ideal. The app is doing nothing except handling a few aspects of session management and authentication - I\u0027d rather keep it that way.",
